## Requirements

- PHP8 (up to 8.4)
- php-curl

## Installation

### Install the server

Below a document root of a website create a directory [webroot]/appmonitor/ (sure it works to install the server into webroot too).

- download zip file from Github: <https://github.com/iml-it/appmonitor>
- create a subdir "appmonitor" below your webroot
- extract all files of the public_html subdir from this archive into [webroot]/appmonitor/
- verify the installation with your browser
  <http://localhost/appmonitor/server/>
  You will see a welcome message.
- Go to the setup.
- Add the url <http://localhost/appmonitor/client/check-appmonitor-server.php> to integrate a first check.

### Install server with git

To use git you need access to the webserver configuration to be able to define a webroot that must point to the public_html folder.

As root:

```shell
cd /var/www
git clone https://github.com/iml-it/appmonitor.git
chown -R www-data. appmonitor
```

Create a vhost with a webroot on `/var/www/appmonitor/public_html`

Open the Webinterface on webroot, eg. <http://localhost/>

You will see a welcome message. Go to the settings page and add this url:
`http://localhost/client/check-appmonitor-server.php`
This is the self check of the appmonitor server.

### Using a Docker container

The repository includes my development environment.

You need

- a running rootless docker service
- docker-compose
- bash
- acl (to use command setfacl)

Clone the git repository and start a bash script.

With your desktop user:

```shell
cd somewhere
git clone https://github.com/iml-it/appmonitor.git
cd appmonitor
./docker/init.sh
```

There you have a menu.

```txt
>>>>> MENU
   g  - remove git data of starterkit

   i  - init application: set permissions
   t  - generate files from templates
   T  - remove generated files

   u  - startup containers    docker-compose ... up -d
   U  - startup containers    docker-compose ... up -d --build
   s  - shutdown containers   docker-compose stop
   r  - remove containers     docker-compose rm -f

   m  - more infos
   o  - open app [appmonitor] http://localhost:8001/
   c  - console (bash)
   p  - console check with php linter

   q  - quit
```

From top down press ...

- `i` - it sets permissions for your current user and the apache httpd user of the container onto the public_html directory.
- `t` - generate configuration files for the docker container and docker compose.
- `u` - start container

Remark: `i` and `t` are needed only once.

It starts up a Apache 2.4 + PHP 8.3 instance and uses the public_html subdir as webroot.
After bringing up the container it starts the monitoring service and shows its log.

In the webbrowser open <http://localhost:8001/>. You will see a welcome message. Go to the settings page and add this url:
`http://localhost/client/check-appmonitor-server.php`
This is the self check of the appmonitor server.

### Production use

If you are happy with the first clicks around then continue the next chaprters.
