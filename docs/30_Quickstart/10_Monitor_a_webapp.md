## Server

**You need a server installation** to have a web interface and to send notifications.
The server needs PHP and can be installed when a machine has PHP installed.

You also can install it on your local machine or a dedicated system

* using Apache httpd/ Nginx and php or
* using docker

You can check the application status in your network or on shared hosting.

ðŸ‘‰ See [Server -> Installation](../40_Server/10_Installation.md)

## PHP webapp

You run a PHP application and want to monitor it. Your luck: A PHP client is delivered in the project. 

* Install the Appmonitor client
* Configure the Appmonitor client

### Install the Appmonitor client

On you system with the web application you need to install the Appmonitor client. 
On a shared hosting you can create a subdirectory eg. `[webroot]/appmonitor/`.
If you have more control you can install it outside webroot and add an alias `/appmonitor`. 

ðŸ‘‰ See [Install the Appmonitor client](../60_PHP-client/20_Install_PHP-client.md)

### Configure the Appmonitor client

* If you run a PHP application, where a pre defined client check is delivered (see `./client/plugins/apps/`) then you are lucky again and can profit from it: you can start with a preset of application specific checks.<br>ðŸ‘‰ See [Use Application checks](../70_PHP-client/60_Plugins/10_Apps/10_Introduction.md)<br><br>

* If not: the folder `./client/plugins/checks/` contains several check items to test http connections, database connections, files and more.<br>You can create your own application check with these check plugins.<br>ðŸ‘‰ See [Write Checks](../70_PHP-client/30_Monitor_an_application.md)

## Non-PHP webapp

You need to implement the checks and a JSON response in the given format.

ðŸ‘‰ See [Decription of response](../50_Client/20_Description_of_response.md)

You can implent it in your favourite programming language ... or try the 

ðŸ‘‰ [Appmonitor CLI binary](https://os-docs.iml.unibe.ch/appmonitor-cli-client/)
